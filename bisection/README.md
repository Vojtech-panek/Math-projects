## Bisection Method

### Overview
The bisection method is a root-finding algorithm that repeatedly bisects an interval and then selects a subinterval in which a root must lie for further processing. It is a simple and robust method, although it converges slowly.

### Mathematical Background
For a continuous function f(x), if f(a) and f(b) have opposite signs, then by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there exists at least one root in the interval [a, b].

The algorithm works as follows:
1. Start with an interval [a, b] where f(a) and f(b) have opposite signs
2. Calculate the midpoint c = (a + b) / 2
3. If f(c) is sufficiently close to zero, c is the approximate root
4. Otherwise, create a new interval:
   - If f(c) and f(a) have the same sign, the root is in [c, b]
   - If f(c) and f(a) have opposite signs, the root is in [a, c]
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until convergence or maximum iterations

### Implementation C
The implementation can be found in `bisection.c`. The current version solves the equation xÂ³ - 2 = 0, finding the cube root of 2.
### Implementation Python
The implementation can be found in `bisection.py`. User inputs solved equation
